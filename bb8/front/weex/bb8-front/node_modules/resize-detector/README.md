# Resize Detector

This project is basically a modified version of [sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resize](#sdecimajavascript-detect-element-resize) including these changes:

* Try to utilize native `ResizeObserver` first.
* Use ES Modules.
* Put most CSS content inside a separate `.css` file.
* Drop support for IE8 and below.
* Make the package available from npm.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i --save resize-detector
```

## Usage

```js
import resizeDetector from 'resize-detector'

// adding listener
resizeDetector.addListener(elem, callback)

// removing listener
resizeDetector.removeListener(elem, callback)
```

*`this` inside `callback` function is the element whose size has been changed.*

## Limitations and caveats

## Comparison with other projects

### [sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resize](//github.com/sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resize)

- **Is polyfill?**

  No.

- **Native first**

  No.

- **Strategy**

  Scroll-based.

- **Pros**

  * Small size.
  * Higher performance comparing to hidden `<object>`s.
  * Compatible with down to IE7.

- **Side effects**

  * Targets with `position: static` will become `position: relative`.
  * Several hidden elements will be injected into the target elements.

- **Limitations**

  * Cannot track detach/attach or visibility change on IE10 and below.

### [que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill](//github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill)

- **Is polyfill**

  Yes.

- **Native first**

  Yes.

- **Fallback Strategy**

  Use `MutationObserver` to observe every mutation in a document. For IE9/10, use Mutation Events instead.

- **Pros**

  * Small size.
  * Minimal side effects on target elements.
  * Can track detach/attach or visibility change as soon as it's triggered by DOM mutation.

- **Limitations**

  * Need extra transition event handling to catch size change from user interaction pseudo classes like `:hover`.
  * Delayed transitions will receive only one notification with the latest dimensions of an element.

### [developit/simple-element-resize-detector](//github.com/developit/simple-element-resize-detector)

- **Is polyfill**

  No.

- **Native first**

  No.

- **Strategy**

  Listen to `resize` events via hidden `<iframe>`s.

- **Pros**

  Dead simple.

- **Side effects**

  * Targets with `position: static` will become `position: relative`.
  * Several hidden elements will be injected into the target elements.
  * Relatively low performance.

- **Limitations**

  * Inapplicable for void elements.
  * Cannot track detach/attach or visibility change.

### [pelotoncycle/resize-observer](//github.com/pelotoncycle/resize-observer)

- **Is polyfill?**

  Yes.

- **Native first**

  Yes.

- **Fallback Strategy**

  Long polling through `requestAnimationFrame` or `setTimeout`.

- **Pros**

  Dead simple.

- **Side effects**

  * Might be not so performant by checking rendered sizes in each animation frame.

### [wnr/element-resize-detector](//github.com/wnr/element-resize-detector)

- **Is polyfill?**

  No.

- **Native first**

  No.

- **Strategy**

  Either hidden `<object>`s or scroll-based.

- **Pros**

  Two approaches available (Really, why?) with scroll-based approach being much faster than hidden `<object>`s.

- **Side effects**

  * Targets with `position: static` will become `position: relative`.
  * Several hidden elements will be injected into the target elements.

- **Limitations**

  * Package size is relatively large.
  * Inapplicable for void elements.
  * Cannot track detach/attach or visibility change.
